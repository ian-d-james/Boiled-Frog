							<p>The boiled frog story is a cautionary fable that warns us of the risks that arise when we choose to 
							   ignore or deny change. Like the ostrich, we can choose to bury our heads in the sand, ignore change, 
							   deny the evidence, and thereby place ourselves in peril.</p>
							<p>Change can be rapid and obvious or it can be slow and subtle. The following excerpt is from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Quinn">
								Daniel Quinn's</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_B">The story of B</a>:</p>

							<p style="color:#1472A8; margin-left:30px; margin-right:60px; font-style:italic;">"If you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, 
							   it will of course frantically try to clamber out. But if 
							   you place it gently in a pot of tepid water and turn the heat on low, it will float there quite placidly. 
							   As the water gradually heats up, the frog will sink into a tranquil stupor, exactly like one of us in a hot bath, 
							   and before long, with a smile on its face, it will unresistingly allow itself to be boiled to death."</p>
								<image src="../images/scientific_consensus_post.jpg" style="margin-top:4px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:20px; float:right;">   

							<p>Historically, climate change, has been largely characterized as a slow and incremental process. We might be excused, therefore, for ignoring or
								disputing climatic changes such as temperature and CO2 elevations over the past 250 years. What is inexcusable, however, is choosing to disregard 
								a virtual consensus (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm">97%</a>) amongst 
								our subject matter experts (climate scientists).</p>

							<p>Would you choose to disregard your doctor's diagnosis and recommended treatment if you or your family were critically ill? Would you rely on 
							   the opinions of amateurs, laymen and other non-professionals (such as politicians)? Would you not instead seek your doctor's professional expertise, 
							   skills and experience? With so much at stake, you might want a second or third opinion because even experts are sometimes mistaken. 
							   With the supporting expert opinions, you could make the best treatment decision possible.</p>
								
							<p>Recognizing and mitigating climate change deserves similar objectivity and subject matter expertise. In fact, even more so, as the decision making 
							   (or lack thereof) impacts not just yourself, but your family, neighbors, country and our global community. Choosing to dismiss the shared conclusions 
							   and recommendations of virtually <a target="_blank" href="https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/">all scientific professionals and organizations</a>
							   constitutes wilful ignorance and, arguably, civil and criminal negligence.</p>

							<p>This site does not reiterate arguments for man-made climate change. There are many sites (see landing page) providing compelling scientific evidence and 
							   expert testimony that man is driving and accelerating climate change. Instead, this site moves beyond the argument and targets individuals and organizations 
							   seeking strategies and actions to hold our educators, politicians, corporations and governments accountable for current and future climate policy. To hold
							   today's decision-makers accountable for the growing climate consequences that will be borne by our children and grandchildren.
